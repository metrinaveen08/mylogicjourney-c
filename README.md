# My Logic Journey - C

This repository contains the code I wrote during my first year of learning the C programming language. It showcases my journey and progress in understanding and applying various C programming concepts.

## Contents

- **Basic Programs:** Simple programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts like variables, loops, and conditionals.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Algorithms:** Various algorithms including sorting, searching, and other problem-solving techniques.
- **Project Work:** Larger projects that integrate multiple concepts and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the language.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process and provide a reference for others who are also learning C. By sharing my code and solutions, I hope to help fellow learners and receive feedback to improve my skills.

## How to Use

1. **Browse the Code:** Explore the different folders and files to see the programs and projects I have worked on.
2. **Run the Code:** Clone the repository to your local machine and compile the C files using a C compiler.
3. **Learn and Experiment:** Use the code as a reference or starting point for your own experiments and learning.
